Hey there.

I'm a person who likes exploring hobbies. My exploring process first starts with something I believe could be improved. Now I contribute code to my favorite game long-term. Another hobby I do is collecting. I like attempting to repair broken used electronics, test different keyboard switches and store them in jars, and more recently, figures to display.

You can find me on these [social platforms](/social).
